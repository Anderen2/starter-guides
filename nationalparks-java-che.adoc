== Exercise: Setup Your Workspace on Eclipse Che

Follow these instructions to setup the development environment on Eclipse Che. 

You might be familiar with the Eclipse IDE which is one of the most popular IDEs for Java and other
programming languages. link::https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che] is the next-generation Eclipse IDE which is web-based
and gives you a full-featured IDE running in the cloud. You have an Eclipse Che instance deployed on your OpenShift cluster
which you will use during these labs.

You can manually configure your development environment. 

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://che-{{INFRA_PROJECT}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/dashboard/#/create-workspace
----

Use the same username and password as your OpenShift credentials.

You can now create your workspace based on a stack. A `stack` is a template of workspace configuration. For example, it includes the programming language and tools needed
in your workspace. Stacks make it possible to recreate identical workspaces with all the tools and needed configuration on-demand. 

For this lab, provide a meaningful name to your workspace, e.g. `nationalparks`, select the **Java with OpenShift CLI** stack, which will provide OpenShift, Java and maven capabilities. Import also a project from Git. Remember we will be importing our project from our internal Gogs server, at the following URL:

CAUTION: In the following url(s), replace `{{ USER_NAME }}` with the Git username provided to you.

[source,bash,role=copypaste]
----
http://gogs-{{INFRA_PROJECT}}.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}/{{ USER_NAME }}/nationalparks
----

And **Add** that project as an import.

Once everything is ready, you can just go ahead and **Create** the workspace.

You should get a dialog once the workspace has been created. This might take some time, so don't be impatient.

Once your workspace has been created, go ahead and click on **Open in Ide**.

You should see the workspace, with your imported project. You can expand the project to see the source code folders.

Or double click on any file to open it on the editor, as any IDE would do.

Now you're ready to do some coding and testing.
